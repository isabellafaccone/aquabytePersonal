    "<h3> The graph above shows that decreasing the baseline does have a significant impact on the percentage accuracy of the depth estimate (while everything else is held constant). This is because the pixels in our sensor will be extremely small since we are using 12 MP cameras, so the error in the disparity estimate that comes from the pixel size does not have significant impact on the results. The disparity errors will largely come from errors in our stereo matching algorithm (i.e incorrect patch correspondences). The graph also shows that for baselines above 6 centimeters, we will not be able to produce a depth map for true depths within 50 cm assuming that the maximum allowed pixel disparity is 600 pixels (this can probably be increased). I think we can probably safely decrease the baseline to around 6 centimeters while barely impacting the accuracy of the depth map estimate -- this comes at the slight cost of less accurate diparity estimates due to the nonzero pixel width, but the cost is probably far outweighed by the benefit of being able to produce well-behaved depth maps for nearby distances (i.e. between 50 cm and 1 m). </h3>\n",

The upside is that it allows us to sample more fish, but I think we want to err on the side of sampling less if it means having more accurate readings on our fish (i.e. we should favor higher precision over higher recall). This graph also shows that having small baselines allows the overlapping region to take up almost the entire field of view, which means that it's very unlikely that a fish will be present in one frame but not the other. But as the previous graph demonstrated, lowering the baseline does come at the small cost of introducing more disparity error, so we should probably not decrease the baseline beyond 6 cm </h3>"

    "<h3> My recommendation assuming a horizontally oriented stereo camera is to have a baseline of 6 cm and a focal length of 1.2 cm. A baseline of 6 cm is small enough such that the effective size of the overlapping region, along with its ratio to field of view, is large. This results in higher sampling frequency and lower likelihood of fish in one frame but not in the other. A relatively small baseline does come with the cost of slightly higher pixel disparity error, but due to the high resolution of our cameras, this is not a big deal as shown in Graph #1. I recommend a focal length of 1.2 cm (or 12 mm) based on the fact that it is a fair compromise between having too small of a FOV (which would result in an increased likelihood of fish being present in one frame but not in the other) and too large of a FOV (which would result in fish taking up a small part of the frame and creating a \"zoomed out\" effect that makes it harder to accurately analyze the fish image charac"
